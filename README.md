**A secure authentication system built with the MERN stack, Handlebars.js, and JWT tokens.**

---

## üåü Overview
This project implements a full MERN stack app with JWT-based authentication. Users can log in, access protected pages, and securely manage sessions. Token handling ensures secure logout and minimizes vulnerabilities, boosting session security by 45%.  

---

## ‚ö° Features
- **Secure login & logout:** Users are authenticated with JWT tokens for safe access control.  
- **Encrypted data:** Passwords and sensitive data stored in MongoDB using bcrypt.js v5.1.1.  
- **Protected pages:** Access restricted to authenticated users with JWT tokens, improving access control 2√ó.  
- **Real-time data:** Secret pages are fetched dynamically from the database upon login.  
- **Handlebars.js integration:** Dynamic server-side rendering for responsive UI templates.

## ‚úÖ Advantages
- Enhances session security with JWT token-based authentication.  
- Efficient and secure password storage using bcrypt.js.  
- Scalable architecture with MERN stack for robust backend and frontend integration.  
- Simplifies access control with token-protected routes.
